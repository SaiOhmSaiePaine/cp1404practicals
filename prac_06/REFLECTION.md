# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started watching the lecture videos regularly and learning from internet to improve my understanding of lists, tuples, dictionaries, and classes. This consistent practice has helped me reinforce the concepts and improve my problem-solving skills.  

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to allocate more time to working on complex problems that integrate multiple concepts, such as combining lists, dictionaries, and exception in a single project. Additionally, I should adopt a more proactive attitude towards seeking help when I'm stuck, whether from online, classmates, or instructors.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been effectively using Git for version control, which has significantly improved my workflow. By regularly committing my code and writing clear commit messages, I can track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if necessary. This practice has helped me maintain organized and well-documented code repositories.
## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop relying solely on tutorials and start working on my projects. This will force me to apply what I've learned in real-world scenarios, helping me to understand the concepts more deeply. Additionally, I should stop procrastinating and start my assignments earlier to avoid last-minute stress.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would like to see more interdisciplinary projects that integrate concepts from other subjects, such as combining Python programming with data analysis or web development. This approach would provide a more holistic learning experience and better prepare students for real-world scenarios.
