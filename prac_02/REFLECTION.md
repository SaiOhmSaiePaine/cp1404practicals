# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched over 80% of the lecture videos, skipping sections I'm already familiar with to better allocate my time towards understanding more challenging topics. This method helps me maximize my learning efficiency.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I schedule my video watching sessions during my free time, aiming to complete at least one video per session. Most often, I watch the remaining videos in the evening or at night, adjusting the duration of my study periods based on the length of each video and my available time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I excel at interpreting instructions and understanding the required processes for coding tasks, which has been crucial in writing effective programs. Going forward, I plan to enhance my planning and detailing skills to improve my code efficiency and problem-solving abilities."

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I am proficient at understanding what needs to be coded and identifying the necessary components. However, I need to focus on improving my actual coding skills to write cleaner, more efficient code. Enhancing these skills will allow me to implement my solutions more effectively.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I need to improve my time management during practicals, as I often spend too long on specific tasks. I plan to set stricter time limits and use structured planning tools to enhance my coding efficiency and complete practical tasks more effectively.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am quite good at understanding and implementing coding processes effectively in practicals, quickly grasping task requirements and necessary components. I plan to continue leveraging this strength to efficiently tackle coding problems.
